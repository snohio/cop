ChefConf 2022 Community of Practice Planning and Presentation Repo

As of right now, we're using this for Issue / Topic tracking for our presentation. I might put together a remark.js style presentation and publish it on pages, but we'll see!

30 minutes

- Introductions
  - Slide for each? Or just one?
  - Introduce myself as Solution Architect from Orlando, Florida with experience building and running a community of practice.

Some topics will include discussions of: Community of Practice over Centers of Excellence, how to run office hours, town halls, develop internal training programs, and will cover the time and effort needed to manage it all.
